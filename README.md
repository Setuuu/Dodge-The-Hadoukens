# Dodge-The-Hadoukens
Solo project created in 2017 using Python and Pygame! Based on a game designed and created by me in 2016 using Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/111490363/)

Instructions:

Use the UP and DOWN arrows on your keyboard to move your character up and down the scrolling platforms!
Going up when at the highest platform will place you down at the lowest platform!

WATCH OUT FOR THE HADOUKENS!
